<h2>Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset</h2>

<p>This is the first programming assignment of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!</p>

<p>As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
<li>Learn how to minimize the cost function.
<li>Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Planar data classification with a hidden layer</h2>

<p>This is the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization.
 In this notebook you will generate red and blue points to form a flower.
 You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points.
 You will try different layers and see the results.</p>

 <p>By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
 <li>Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
 <li>Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
</ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step</h2>

 <p>Welcome to your third programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
  <li>Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
  <li>Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
 </ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Deep Neural Network - Application</h2>

 <p>Welcome to the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will now use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.</p>

 <img src="image_classification_using_neural_network/images/Cat_image.png" width="550" height="250">

 <p>In the second exercise, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this assignment, you will learn:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
 <li>Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
 <li>Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
 </ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Initialization</h2>

 This is the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. It is very important that you regularize your model properly because it could dramatically improve your results.

 By completing this assignment you will be learning:

 <ul>
 <li>Understand that different initialization methods and their impact on your model performance
 <li>Implement zero initialization and and see it fails to "break symmetry",
 <li>Recognize that random initialization "breaks symmetry" and yields more efficient models,
 <li>Understand that you could use both random initialization and scaling to get even better training performance on your model.
 </ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Regularization</h2>

 <p>This is the second part of the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. It is very important that you regularize your model properly because it could dramatically improve your results.
 </p>

 By completing this assignment you will be learning:
 <ul>
 <li>Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.
 <li>Implement dropout and see it work on data.
 <li>Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.
 <li>Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
 <hr>

 <h2>Gradient Checking<h2>

 <p>This is the third part of the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. You will be implementing gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. By completing this assignment you will be learning:

 <ul>
 <li>Implement gradient checking from scratch.
 <li>Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.
 <li>Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.
 <li>Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
 </ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Optimization</h2>

 <p>Welcome to the optimization's programming assignment of the hyper-parameters tuning specialization. There are many different optimization algorithms you could be using to get you to the minimal cost. Similarly, there are many different paths down this hill to the lowest point.</p>

 <img scr="optimization_methods/images/image01.PNG" width="250" height="250">

 By completing this assignment you will be learning:

 <ul>
 <li>Understand the intuition between Adam and RMS prop
 <li>Recognize the importance of mini-batch gradient descent
 <li>Learn the effects of momentum on the overall performance of your model
 </ul>
 <hr>

 <h2>Tensorflow</h2>

 <p>Welcome to the Tensorflow Tutorial! In this notebook you will learn all the basics of Tensorflow. You will implement useful functions and draw the parallel with what you did using Numpy. You will understand what Tensors and operations are, as well as how to execute them in a computation graph.</p>

 <p>After completing this assignment you will also be able to implement your own deep learning models using Tensorflow. In fact, using our brand new SIGNS dataset, you will build a deep neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy.</p>
