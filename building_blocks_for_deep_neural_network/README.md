<h1>Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step</h1>

 <p>Welcome to your third programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
  <li>Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
  <li>Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
 </ul>
