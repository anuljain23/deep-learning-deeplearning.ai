<h1>Planar data classification with a hidden layer</h1>

<p>This is the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization.
 In this notebook you will generate red and blue points to form a flower.
 You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points.
 You will try different layers and see the results.</p>

 <p>By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 - Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

 - Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

 - Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
