<h1>Gradient Checking<h1>

<p>This is the third part of the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. You will be implementing gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. By completing this assignment you will be learning:

<ul>
<li>Implement gradient checking from scratch.
<li>Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.
<li>Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.
<li>Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
</ul>
