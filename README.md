<h2>Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset</h2>

<p>This is the first programming assignment of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!</p>

<p>As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
- Learn how to minimize the cost function.
- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

<h2>Planar data classification with a hidden layer</h2>

<p>This is the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization.
 In this notebook you will generate red and blue points to form a flower.
 You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points.
 You will try different layers and see the results.</p>

 <p>By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 - Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
 - Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
 - Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
