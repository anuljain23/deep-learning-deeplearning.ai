<h2>Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset</h2>

<p>This is the first programming assignment of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!</p>

<p>As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
<li>Learn how to minimize the cost function.
<li>Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
</ul>

<h2>Planar data classification with a hidden layer</h2>

<p>This is the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization.
 In this notebook you will generate red and blue points to form a flower.
 You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points.
 You will try different layers and see the results.</p>

 <p>By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
 <li>Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
 <li>Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.
</ul>

 <h2>Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step</h2>

 <p>Welcome to your third programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
  <li>Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
  <li>Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
 </ul>
