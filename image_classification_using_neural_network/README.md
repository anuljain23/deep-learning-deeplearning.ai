<h1>Deep Neural Network - Application</h1>

<p>Welcome to the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will now use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.</p>

<p>In the second exercise, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this assignment, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
<li>Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
<li>Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
</ul>
