# Initialization

This is the first assignment of the hyper parameters tuning specialization. It is very important that you regularize your model properly because it could dramatically improve your results.

By completing this assignment you will be learning:

<ul>
<li>Understand that different initialization methods and their impact on your model performance
<li>Implement zero initialization and and see it fails to "break symmetry",
<li>Recognize that random initialization "breaks symmetry" and yields more efficient models,
<li>Understand that you could use both random initialization and scaling to get even better training performance on your model.
</ul>
