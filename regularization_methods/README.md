By completing this assignment you will be learning:
<ul>
<li>Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.
<li>Implement dropout and see it work on data.
<li>Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.
<li>Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
